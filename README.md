#Project Idea: With COVID came many restaurants not being able to operate in traditional ways. With everything transitioning to online ordering options, many old school restaurants didnâ€™t have a website nevermind an online ordering system in place. We brainstormed to make an app that allows restaurants to easily load in their menu and prices, and allow customers to select their items, place their order, and even checkout with google pay. The menu and orders will be stored in a firebase, working on an android app, with google pay added on.
#We are going to use android studio to display the menu and prices and use firebase to allow customers to create an account and save their information to a firebase console. With there information saved we will be able to keep track of the things they order and save their information so it will be easier for them to order again next time because they would have to sign in. 
#We will also add google pay so the customer is able to pay before they get there, so they easily deliver their food and pick up their food without waiting in long lines inside or in drive thru
#We hope this app will help resturants who are struggling with keeping organized during COVID and hopefully help customers who do not like waiting in long lines and find ordering their favorite food online easier!
