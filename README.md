#Project Idea: With COVID came many restaurants not being able to operate in traditional ways. With everything transitioning to online ordering options, many old school restaurants didnâ€™t have a website nevermind an online ordering system in place. We brainstormed to make an app that allows restaurants to easily load in their menu and prices, and allow customers to select their items, place their order, and even checkout with google pay. The menu and orders will be stored in a firebase, working on an android app, with google pay added on
